      "content": "The user wants a detailed document outline for a business case for a new product. I need to create a comprehensive structure with all the elements they specified, including document overview, detailed structure, content requirements, technical specifications, and additional elements.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the thought process to create the outline:\n\n1. **Understand the Core Request:** The central goal is a business case for a new product. This immediately suggests standard business document components.\n\n2. **Address Explicit Requirements:**  Go through each numbered point in the user's prompt and ensure it's covered in the outline.\n\n    * **Document Overview:**  This is a standard introductory section. I'll include the requested sub-points (target audience, purpose, outcomes, tone, length, format).\n    * **Detailed Structure:** This is the core of the outline. I need to think about the logical flow of a business case. A typical flow includes introduction, problem/opportunity, solution (the new product), implementation, financial analysis, and conclusion. I'll break these down into sections and subsections.\n    * **Content Requirements:** For each section and subsection, I'll add bullet points specifying what information is needed, data requirements, examples, and citations.\n    * **Technical Specifications:**  This is about the document's presentation. I'll include format, layout, typography, visual elements, and citation style.\n    * **Additional Elements:**  These are the supplementary parts of the document. I'll include front matter, executive summary, appendices, glossary, and index.\n\n3. **Structure the Detailed Sections:**  Think about the logical progression of a business case:\n\n    * **Introduction:** Set the stage, introduce the product concept.\n    * **Problem/Opportunity:**  Why is this product needed? What market gap does it fill?\n    * **Solution (The New Product):**  Describe the product in detail.\n    * **Market Analysis:**  Who are the customers? What's the competitive landscape?\n    * **Marketing and Sales Strategy:** How will the product be sold?\n    * **Implementation Plan:** How will the product be developed and launched?\n    * **Financial Analysis:**  Is this product financially viable?\n    * **Risk Assessment:** What are the potential challenges?\n    * **Conclusion:** Summarize the key findings and recommendations.\n\n4. **Populate Subsections and Content Requirements:** For each section, brainstorm relevant subsections and then think about the specific information needed in each. For example, under \"Market Analysis,\" subsections like \"Target Market,\" \"Market Size,\" and \"Competitive Analysis\" are logical. Then, for \"Target Market,\" specify the need for demographics, psychographics, etc.\n\n5. **Consider Visual Elements:**  Think about where tables, charts, and images would be most effective in conveying information. Financial data lends itself to tables and charts, while product features might benefit from images.\n\n6. **Address Technical Specifications:**  List the common technical aspects of document creation.\n\n7. **Include Additional Elements:**  Ensure all the requested additional elements are present. For the executive summary, highlight its importance and key content.\n\n8. **Add Guidance and Explanations:** In the \"message_to_andika\" section, provide context and explain the reasoning behind certain choices. Also, ask clarifying questions to ensure the outline meets the user's specific needs. For example, asking about the product type and industry is crucial for tailoring the outline.\n\n9. **Format in Markdown:** Ensure the entire outline is formatted correctly using Markdown syntax as requested.\n\n10. **Review and Refine:**  Read through the entire outline to ensure logical flow, completeness, and clarity. Check for any redundancies or missing elements. Make sure the language is clear and concise. For example, initially, I might have just said \"Marketing,\" but \"Marketing and Sales Strategy\" is more specific. Similarly, adding \"Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)\" under \"Financial Analysis\" adds valuable detail.```json\n{\n  \"message_to_andika\": \"Hello Andika, this is a comprehensive document outline for your business case for a new product.
